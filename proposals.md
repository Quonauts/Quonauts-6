# Quonauts 6 — Proposals

<a name='1'/>

## #1

Quonauts 6 ends immediately and Quonauts 1 starts all over again.

<a name='2'/>

## #2

Create a rule section within `Roles` named `Rule offender`:
> Any player which has 1 or more strikes gains the rule offender role. Rule offenders cannot participate in the game (perform any game actions). After 24 hours, a players strike count will decrease by 1, if above 0. If a players strike count is 0, the Rule Offender role will be removed.

<a name='3'/>

## #3

Create a rule section after "Modifying proposals" named "Disallowed in proposals" (this proposal depends on proposal #2):
> Proposals may not give any players any more power than others. An exception to this rule is the Rule Offender role, and any power gained via some form of quantity.
> 
> Power here is defined as the abillity to do some game action, or having more abillity to do some game action than others, or being able to win the game. (e.g "Sinthorion wins the game." breaks this rule, but "Any player with 1000000 moon cheese or more wins the game." does not.)

## #4

Out of Game Information

Create rule #9, named “Out of Game Information”

> Out of game information is any information that exists outside of the confines and variables of the game. This information includes but is not limited to:
> The player’s username, presence on the internet, and messages in other channels or servers.
> Some examples of *In Game Information* are the players votes, player’s quantities, proposals, or messages sent in the Quonauts 6 category.

<a name='5'/>

## #5

Append the following to rule 5.3:

> The player passing the proposal may choose to add or remove whitespace and fix typos or grammar mistakes as needed so long as the meaning of the proposal remains unchanged. Clarifications or additional details should always be added by means of a new proposal.

<a name='6'/>

## #6

Alternative to proposal #3, the purpose of this proposal is to ensure more freedom while protecting minorities from unfair majority rulings.

This proposal depends on proposal #2 and proposal #4. If this proposal passes, any effects of proposal #3 will be retroactively undone and overwritten by this proposal.

Create a rule section after "Modifying proposals" named "Disallowed in proposals"

> Proposals may not create an unfair advantage for minorities based on Out of Game Information. Wether this has occurred can be determined through a formal poll, and the effects will be undone as necessary.

<a name='7'/>

## #7

Create a rule section after "<#660555000296112128>" named "#transactions"
> The #transactions channel may be used to modify quantities, but only as the game rules allow quantities to be changed.

<a name='8'/>

## #8

Overwrite the rule section "Quantities" with the following:
> A quantity is a named property with a numerical value for each player.
> 
> By default any unique quantity added to the game:
> 
> • applies to all players
> • is instantiated at zero
> • must always be an integer
> • must never have a negative value
> • cannot be traded or exchanged
> 
> The following quantities exist:
> 
> • Strike
> • Point

## #2

Create a rule section within `Roles` named `Rule offender`:
> Any player which has 1 or more strikes gains the rule offender role. Rule offenders cannot participate in the game (perform any game actions). After 24 hours, a players strike count will decrease by 1, if above 0. If a players strike count is 0, the Rule Offender role will be removed.
